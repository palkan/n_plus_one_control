# N + 1 Control

RSpec and Minitest matchers to prevent the N+1 queries problem.

### Why yet another gem to assert DB queries?

Unlike other libraries (such as [db-query-matchers](https://github.com/brigade/db-query-matchers), [rspec-sqlimit](https://github.com/nepalez/rspec-sqlimit), etc), with `n_plus_one_control` you don't have to specify exact expectations to control your code behaviour (e.g. `expect { subject }.to query(2).times`).

Such expectations are rather hard to maintain, 'cause there is a big chance of adding more queries, not related to the system under test.

NPlusOneControl works differently. It evaluates the code under consideration several times with different scale factors to make sure that the number of DB queries behaves as expected (i.e. O(1) instead of O(N)).

So, it's for _performance_ testing and not _feature_ testing.

### Why not just use [`bullet`](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet)?

Of course, it's possible to use Bullet in tests (see more [here](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/fighting-the-hydra-of-n-plus-one-queries)), but it's not a _silver bullet_: there can be both false positives and true negatives.

This gem was born after I've found myself not able to verify with a test yet another N+1 problem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'n_plus_one_control'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### RSpec

First, add NPlusOneControl to your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
# spec_helper.rb
...

require "n_plus_one_control/rspec"
```

Then:

```ruby
# Wrap example into a context with :n_plus_one tag
context "N+1", :n_plus_one do
  # Define `populate` callbacks which is responsible for data
  # generation (and whatever else).
  #
  # It accepts one argument – the scale factor (read below)
  populate { |n| create_list(:post, n) }

  specify do
    expect { get :index }.to perform_constant_number_of_queries
  end
end
```

**NOTE:** do not use memoized values within the expectation block!

```ruby
# BAD – won't work!

subject { get :index }

specify do
  expect { subject }.to perform_constant_number_of_queries
end
```

Availables modifiers:

```ruby
# You can specify the RegExp to filter queries.
# By default, it only considers SELECT queries.
expect { ... }.to perform_constant_number_of_queries.matching(/INSERT/)

# You can also provide custom scale factors
expect { ... }.to perform_constant_number_of_queries.with_scale_factors(10, 100)
```

### Minitest

First, add NPlusOneControl to your `test_helper.rb`:

```ruby
# test_helper.rb
...

require "n_plus_one_control/minitest"
```

Then use `assert_perform_constant_number_of_queries` assertion method:

```ruby
def test_no_n_plus_one_error
  populate = ->(n) { create_list(:post, n) }

  assert_perform_constant_number_of_queries(populate: populate) do
    get :index
  end
end
```

You can also specify custom scale factors or filter patterns:

```ruby
assert_perform_constant_number_of_queries(
  populate: populate,
  scale_factors: [2, 5, 10]
) do
  get :index
end

assert_perform_constant_number_of_queries(
  populate: populate,
  matching: /INSERT/
) do
  do_some_havey_stuff
end
```

You can also specify `populate` as a test class instance method:

```ruby
def populate(n)
  create_list(:post, n)
end

def test_no_n_plus_one_error
  assert_perform_constant_number_of_queries do
    get :index
  end
end
```

### Configuration

There are some global configuration parameters (and their corresponding defaults):

```ruby
# Default scale factors to use.
# We use the smallest possible but representative scale factors by default.
NPlusOneControl.default_scale_factors = [2, 3]

# Print performed queries if true in the case of failure
# You can activate verbosity through env variable NPLUSONE_VERBOSE=1
NPlusOneControl.verbose = false

# Ignore matching queries
NPlusOneControl.ignore = /^(BEGIN|COMMIT|SAVEPOINT|RELEASE)/

# ActiveSupport notifications event to track queries.
# We track ActiveRecord event by default,
# but can also track rom-rb events ('sql.rom') as well.
NPlusOneControl.event = 'sql.active_record'

# configure transactional behavour for populate method
# in case of use multiple database connections
NPlusOneControl::Executor.tap do |executor|
  connections = ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.connection_pool_list.map(&:connection)

  executor.transaction_begin = proc do
    connections.each { |connection| connection.begin_transaction(joinable: false) }
  end
  executor.transaction_rollback = proc do
    connections.each(&:rollback_transaction)
  end
end
```

## How does it work?

Take a look at our [Executor](https://github.com/palkan/n_plus_one_control/blob/master/lib/n_plus_one_control/executor.rb) to figure out what's under the hood.

## What's next?

It may be useful to provide more matchers/assertions, for example:

```ruby

# Actually, that means that it is N+1))
assert_linear_number_of_queries { ... }

# But we can tune it with `coef` and handle such cases as selecting in batches
assert_linear_number_of_queries(coef: 0.1) do
  Post.find_in_batches { ... }
end

# probably, also make sense to add another curve types
assert_logarithmic_number_of_queries { ... }
```
